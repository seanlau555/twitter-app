Due to the CORS blocking from twitter, we cannot access the resources directly from frontend. I use the dummy data to present brief logic. On the other hand, following the commented guidence in getTweets.js and appInit.js can testing the actual logic with api call.



development:
yarn start

testing:
yarn test

Create production build:
yarn build
